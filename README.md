# Predict-Movie-Rating
A  machine-learning approach to predicting movie ratings.
We train a regression model on a movie rating dataset and its corresponding features and evaluate its performance on a test set. 
We use several machine learning models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting Regressor to confirm the modelâ€™s effectiveness based on its attributes.
